# Bike-Sales-Excel-Project

## Project Overview

This project showcases a complete data analysis workflow using Microsoft Excel, culminating in an interactive and dynamic dashboard. The goal was to analyze raw bike sales data, uncover key trends, and present the findings in a clear and compelling visual format for business stakeholders.

## Skills Demonstrated

This project demonstrates proficiency in the following data analysis and visualization skills within Excel:
- Data Cleaning and Preparation: The project began with a raw dataset and involved cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
- Formulas and Functions: Used IF and Nested IF functions to create new, meaningful data categories, such as grouping customer ages into 'Adolescent', 'Middle Age', and 'Old'.
- PivotTables: Built multiple PivotTables to summarize and analyze data by various metrics, including customer demographics, purchase history, and average income.
- Data Visualization: Created charts and graphs to represent key metrics, such as "Average Income Per Purchase" and "Count of Purchased Bike".
- Interactive Dashboards: Designed and built a professional, interactive dashboard to present key insights from the data.
- Slicers: Inserted slicers to allow for easy and dynamic filtering of the data based on criteria like Region, Gender, Marital Status, and Education.

## Key Insights from the Dashboard

The dashboard provides key insights into the company's bike buyers, including:
- Demographics: The dashboard visualizes the distribution of bike buyers by age brackets, gender, and marital status.
- Commute Distance: Analysis of how commute distance affects the likelihood of a bike purchase.
- Regional Performance: The dashboard allows for easy filtering to compare sales performance across different regions, such as North America, Europe, and Pacific.
- Income Analysis: Provides a clear view of the average income per purchase and how it varies by customer segments.
